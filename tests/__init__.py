"""
Initializes the `tests` package.

This file can be left empty as pytest automatically discovers test files
within this directory. If shared test utilities, fixtures, or configurations
were needed across all tests in this package, they would typically be placed
in a `conftest.py` file at the root of the test suite, or within specific
subdirectories if scoped.

For this project, `conftest.py` will handle most global test setup.
